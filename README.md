### **ðŸ“Œ Detailed Description for GitHub Repository**

**"This project predicts Tesla stock price movement (up or down) using historical data and machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification modeling. The dataset contains daily stock information such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Key steps include:**

* **Data Cleaning & Exploration:**

  * Checked for null values and removed unnecessary columns like `Adj Close`.
  * Visualized price trends, distribution of features, and outliers using histograms and boxplots.
  * Created additional features such as `open-close`, `low-high`, and a target variable indicating price increase or decrease.

* **Feature Engineering:**

  * Extracted date components (day, month, year) and added a binary feature `is_quarter_end`.
  * Generated new numerical features to represent price differences.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

  * Plotted stock closing prices over time.
  * Analyzed feature distributions and correlations using heatmaps.

* **Model Development:**

  * Implemented multiple machine learning models including:
    âœ… Logistic Regression
    âœ… Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with polynomial kernel
    âœ… XGBoost Classifier
  * Standardized the features using `StandardScaler`.
  * Split the data into training and validation sets (90-10 split).

* **Performance Evaluation:**

  * Evaluated models using **ROC-AUC score** on training and validation data.
  * Displayed confusion matrix for classification results.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end **classification pipeline** for stock price prediction and serves as a foundation for further enhancement using advanced time-series models like LSTM."
